# Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks for Data Augmentation

This project uses generative adversarial networks for data generation for time-series data. A Gantt chart of the project can be found here: [Dow GAN Gantt Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TDkpIP71Qa-njRVNn1pCFSOW9tKn3kIfl4yciAdwVgk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Description

Collecting large amounts and high resolution of data in industrial fields is often costly and time intensive. General adversarial networks (GANs) are known for augmenting images. We are exploring the potential for GANs to augment time-series data. 

This project is a collaboration between the University of Washington and Dow Chemical.

## Getting Started

### Installing & Dependencies

* Clone github repo into home directory
* Navigate into the dowgan repo from your Home directory using `cd dowgan`
* Create environment by executing at the command line for mac or windows/pc respectively:
```
conda env create -f environment_mac.yml
```
```
conda env create -f environment_windows.yml
```
* To activate environment: `conda activate dowgan`
* To deactivate environment: `conda deactivate`
* To see the list of all conda environments: `conda info --envs`
* To update the environment: 
    * Make any changes required to environment.yml file
    * Then run: `conda env update --file environment_mac/windows.yml --prune`
    * Then make sure to `conda activate dowgan` again to successfully update environment.

### What's included in this repo

* Notebook folder contains work on GANs, CGANs, experimental GAN structures, and transformer models.
* Utility functions for data visualization and data preparation for importing into dataloaders.
