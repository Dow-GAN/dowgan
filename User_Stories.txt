Who are our users? Engineers, technicians, Project managers (managers of the engineers and technicians)
Users will be people working with code (data science practitioner) who want to augment data. Process engineers will be working with data scientists on this.

What do they want to do? Generate time series data.
Modeling potential data. Fitting data? 

What needs and desires do they want for the tool? Simple, fast tool that works by inputting incomplete data. Minimal data required for augmentation.

What is their skill level? Able to run and understand Python code. Likely could operate with git repositories and Jupyter Notebook.

User story: Engineer Tom wants to input some incomplete data into this tool to generate a complete dataset for his manager Alice.
He would like to be able to upload the data, input it into a generative model to create a complete dataset, and check whether the generated data is 'accurate'.

User story: Maybe, Project manager Alice would like to be able to put in data and get out experimental parameters??

Questions we have for Dow: What kind of time-based data will we be generating? What is the motivation for this tool? Who are the primary users of this tool?
 Will there be any data visualization component -- what types of visualization?
