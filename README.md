# Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks for Data Augmentation

This project uses generative adversarial networks for data generation for time-series data.

## Description

Collecting large amounts and high resolution of data in industrial fields is often costly and time intensive. General adversarial networks (GANs) are known for augmenting images. We are exploring the potential for GANs to augment time-series data. 

This project is a collaboration between the University of Washington and Dow Chemical.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing/Modifications

* Clone github repo into home directory
* Modify parameters and preferences for GAN model by editing `dataloader.py` file parameters

### Executing program

* Clone github repo into home directory
* Navigate to '../dowgan/dowgan' folder
* To run GAN on default Hungary Chicken Pox Data, execute at the command line:
```
python3 dataloader.py
```

## Help
