Use Case 1: Generate synthetic data
User input: Time series data (incomplete, fewer points, experimentally derived datapoints)
User receives: Large time series data set (synthetic data)
Potential: system response analysis, component testing, data visualization/modelling

Use Case 2: Using GAN Model for making another model (testing different plant components)
User input: New dataset with different dependency on time
User receives: New model for time series data for different part of plant/component

Use Case 3: Improve resolution of data
User inputs: Low resolution data (data that has greater time intervals)
User receives: Interpolated data points (smaller time interval)
